<h1>Main Section Title</h1>

<div class="drop-cap">I</div><p>f a man walk in the woods for love of them half of each day, he is in danger of being regarded as a loafer; but if he spends his whole day as a speculator, shearing off those woods and making earth bald before her time, he is esteemed an industrious and enterprising citizen.</p>

<h2>Main Crosshead</h2>

<p>The ways by which you may get money almost without exception lead downward. To have done anything by which you earned money merely is to have been truly idle or worse. If the laborer gets no more than the wages which his employer pays him, he is cheated, he cheats himself. If you would get money as a writer or lecturer, you must be popular, which is to go down perpendicularly. &#8230;</p>

<h3>Heavy Crosshead</h3>

<p>In proportion as our inward life fails, we go more constantly and desperately to the post-office. You may depend on it, that the poor fellow who walks away with the greatest number of letters, proud of his extensive correspondence, has not heard from himself this long while.</p>

<h4>Medium Crosshead</h4>

<p>I do not know but it is too much to read one newspaper a week. I have tried it recently, and for so long it seems to me that I have not dwelt in my native region. The sun, the clouds, the snow, the trees say not so much to me. &#8230;</p>

<h5>Light Crosshead</h5>

<p>You cannot serve two masters. It requires more than a day&#8217;s devotion to know and to possess the wealth of a day. &#8230; Really to see the sun rise or go down every day, so to relate ourselves to a universal fact, would preserve us sane forever.</p>

<div class="run-in-sidehead">Run-in Sidehead</div><p>Shall the mind be a public arena, where the affairs of the street and the gossip of the tea-table chiefly are discussed? Or shall it be a quarter of heaven itself, an hyp&aelig;thral temple, consecrated to the service of the gods?</p>
