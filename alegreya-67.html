<h1>Main Section Title</h1>

<p>If I am to be a thoroughfare, I prefer that it be of the mountain-brooks, the Parnassian streams, and not the town-sewers. &#8230; I believe that the mind can be permanently profaned by the habit of attending to trivial things, so that all our thoughts shall be tinged with triviality.</p>

<h2>Main Crosshead</h2>

<p>Our very intellect shall be macadamized, as it were, its foundation broken into fragments for the wheels of travel to roll over; and if you would know what will make the most durable pavement, surpassing rolled stones, spruce blocks, and asphaltum, you have only to look into some of our minds&#8230;</p>

<h3>Ornamented Crosshead</h3>

<p>Read not the Times. Read the Eternities. &#8230; Even the facts of science may dust the mind by their dryness, unless they are in a sense effaced each morning, or rather rendered fertile by the dews of fresh and living truth.</p>

<h4>Indented Sidehead</h4>

<p>Knowledge does not come to us by details, but in flashes of light from heaven. Yes, every thought that passes through the mind helps to wear and tear it, and to deepen the ruts, which, as in the streets of Pompeii, evince how much it has been used.</p>

<h5>Secondary Indented Sidehead</h5>

<p>When we want culture more than potatoes, and illumination more than sugar-plums, then the great resources of a world are taxed and drawn out, and the result, or staple production, is, not slaves, nor operatives, but &#8230; saints, poets, philosophers. &#8230;</p>

<div class="run-in-sidehead">Run-in Sidehead</div><p>In short, as a snow-drift is formed where there is a lull in the wind, so, one would say, where there is a lull of truth, an institution springs up. &#8230;</p>

<h2>Blockquote</h2>
<p>In <em>Life Without Principle</em>, Henry David Thoreau said:

<blockquote>In short, as a snow-drift is formed where there is a lull in the wind, so, one would say, where there is a lull of truth, an institution springs up.</blockquote><p>
